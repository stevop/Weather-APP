# Weather-APP
- A simple application, which outputs basic weather information of wanted location. 
- I used Open Weather API, Axios library to fetch data and SCSS. 
- To function this app properly, you need to acquire your own API key and put it into the app.js file.

Thanks for checking out this repository.
